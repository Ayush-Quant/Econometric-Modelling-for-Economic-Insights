Title  - Econometric Modelling for Economic Insights: Predicting GNI Using Financial Inclusion Indicators.

This project analyzes the relationship between financial inclusion indicators and a country's Gross National Income (GNI) using econometric modeling. By leveraging regression techniques, the project identifies key predictors of GNI, providing insights into how financial access contributes to economic growth.

üöÄ Project Overview

Objective: To explore whether financial inclusion indicators such as account ownership, income distribution, and education levels can significantly predict GNI.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and imputation using KNN.

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations.

Regression modeling with statistical diagnostics.

Feature selection using stepwise regression.

Analysis of residuals, multicollinearity, and heteroscedasticity.

üìä Dataset

Source: The dataset is sourced from the World Bank DataBank.

Variables:

Dependent Variable: Gross National Income (GNI).

Independent Variables: Financial inclusion indicators such as:
Account ownership by gender, labor force status, and income group.
Educational attainment levels.
Labor force dynamics.
